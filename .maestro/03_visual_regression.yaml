# Visual Regression Test: Capture screenshots for baseline comparison
#
# This test creates screenshots that can be compared over time to detect
# unintended UI changes.
#
# Usage:
# - First run: Creates baseline screenshots
# - Subsequent runs: Compare against baseline to detect changes
#
# Screenshot comparison can be done:
# - Manually (visual inspection)
# - Automated (using image diff tools in CI/CD)
# - Via Maestro Cloud (automatically)

- launchApp
- assertVisible: "Grokipedia"
